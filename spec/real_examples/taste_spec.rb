Add zest and vanilla, then gradually beat in combined flours until mixture just comes together.\nRoll 2 teaspoonsful of dough into balls, placing them on 2 oven trays lined with baking paper. Using a floured flat bottom of a glass, flatten balls to 3.5cm rounds, then, using the back of a floured fork, mark biscuits with tines. Bake for 12 minutes, swapping trays halfway, or until biscuits are light golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Makes 40.\nMeanwhile, to make filling, press pulp through a fine sieve, reserving seeds. Place 2 tablespoons juice, 3 teaspoons reserved seeds and remaining ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat on high speed until fluffy. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.\nSpread filling on 20 biscuits, then sandwich with remaining biscuits. Dust with extra icing sugar to serve." }
